- When you login a new servicer or use new docker container,
- Do you feel depressed, because of the waxy interface?
- Do you feel manic, because there are no coding suggestion?
- Do you feel tired, because you have to use so many service that you can't deploy zsh every service.

Now, you can use zsh.sh to solve this problem.

## Quick Start

PS: you need execute `bash zsh_linux.sh && source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc` by twice
Now: support `Ubuntu` + `CentOS`
ToDo: docker version + MacOS

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iofu728/zsh.sh/master/zsh_linux.sh
bash zsh_linux.sh && source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc
bash zsh_linux.sh && source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc
```
